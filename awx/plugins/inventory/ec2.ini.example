# When generating inventory, Ansible needs to know how to address a server.
# Each EC2 instance has a lot of variables associated with it. Here is the list:
#   http://docs.pythonboto.org/en/latest/ref/ec2.html#module-boto.ec2.instance
# Below are 2 variables that are used as the address of a server:
#   - destination_variable
#   - vpc_destination_variable

# This is the normal destination variable to use. If you are running Ansible
# from outside EC2, then 'public_dns_name' makes the most sense. If you are
# running Ansible from within EC2, then perhaps you want to use the internal
# address, and should set this to 'private_dns_name'. The key of an EC2 tag
# may optionally be used; however the boto instance variables hold precedence
# in the event of a collision.
destination_variable = public_dns_name

# This allows you to override the inventory_name with an ec2 variable, instead
# of using the destination_variable above. Addressing (aka ansible_ssh_host)
# will still use destination_variable. Tags should be written as 'tag_TAGNAME'.
# Invalid characters in the tag or instance variable will be stripped.
#hostname_variable = tag_Name

# For server inside a VPC, using DNS names may not make sense. When an instance
# has 'subnet_id' set, this variable is used. If the subnet is public, setting
# this to 'ip_address' will return the public IP address. For instances in a
# private subnet, this should be set to 'private_ip_address', and Ansible must
# be run from within EC2. The key of an EC2 tag may optionally be used; however
# the boto instance variables hold precedence in the event of a collision.
# WARNING: - instances that are in the private vpc, _without_ public ip address
# will not be listed in the inventory until You set:
# vpc_destination_variable = private_ip_address
vpc_destination_variable = ip_address

# The following two settings allow flexible ansible host naming based on a
# python format string and a comma-separated list of ec2 tags.  Note that:
#
# 1) If the tags referenced are not present for some instances, empty strings
#    will be substituted in the format string.
# 2) This overrides both destination_variable and vpc_destination_variable.
