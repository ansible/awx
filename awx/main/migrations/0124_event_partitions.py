    #
    # the goal of this function is to:
    # - [ ] create a parent partition table, main_jobevent_parent
    # - [ ] .. with a single partition
    # - [ ] .. that includes all existing job events
    #
    # the new main_jobevent_parent table should have a new
    # denormalized column, job_created, this is used as a
    # basis for partitioning job event rows
    #
    # The initial partion will be a unique case. After
    # the migration is completed, awx should create
    # new partitions on an hourly basis, as needed.
    # All events for a given job should be placed in
    # a partition based on the job's _created time_.

    # Only partitioning main_jobevent on first pass
