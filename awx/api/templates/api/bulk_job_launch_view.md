# Bulk Job Launch

This endpoint allows the client to launch multiple UnifiedJobTemplates at a time, along side any launch time parameters that they would normally set at launch time.

Example:

    {
        "name": "my bulk job",
        "jobs": [
            {"unified_job_template": 7, "inventory": 2},
            {"unified_job_template": 7, "credentials": [3]}
        ]
    }
