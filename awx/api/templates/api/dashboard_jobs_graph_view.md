## Parmeters and Filtering

The `period` of the data can be adjusted with:

    ?period=month

Where `month` can be replaced with `week`, or `day`.  `month` is the default.

The type of job can be filtered with:

    ?job_type=all

Where `all` can be replaced with `inv_sync`, `playbook_run` or `scm_update`.  `all` is the default.

## Results

Data will be returned in the following format:

    "jobs": {
            "successful": [
                [
                    1402808400.0, 
                    9

                    3
                ], ... ]

the number of events during that time period
