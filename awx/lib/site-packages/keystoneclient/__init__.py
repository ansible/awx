"""The python bindings for the OpenStack Identity (Keystone) project.

A Client object will allow you to communicate with the Identity server. The
recommended way to get a Client object is to use
:py:func:`keystoneclient.client.Client()`. :py:func:`~.Client()` uses version
discovery to create a V3 or V2 client depending on what versions the Identity
server supports and what version is requested.

Identity V2 and V3 clients can also be created directly. See
:py:class:`keystoneclient.v3.client.Client` for the V3 client and
:py:class:`keystoneclient.v2_0.client.Client` for the V2 client.
