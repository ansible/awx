AWX provides a web-based user interface, REST API, and task engine built on top of [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible). It is the upstream project for [Tower](https://www.ansible.com/tower), a commercial derivative of AWX.  

To install AWX, please view the [Install guide](./INSTALL.md).

To learn more about using AWX, and Tower, view the [Tower docs site](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/index.html).

The AWX Project Frequently Asked Questions can be found [here](https://www.ansible.com/awx-project-faq).

The AWX logos and branding assets are covered by [our trademark guidelines](https://github.com/ansible/awx-logos/blob/master/TRADEMARKS.md).

Contributing
------------

- Refer to the [Contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started developing, testing, and building AWX.
- All code submissions are made through pull requests against the `devel` branch.
- All contributors must use git commit --signoff for any commit to be merged and agree that usage of --signoff constitutes agreement with the terms of [DCO 1.1](./DCO_1_1.md)
- Take care to make sure no merge commits are in the submission, and use `git rebase` vs. `git merge` for this reason.
- If submitting a large code change, it's a good idea to join the `#ansible-awx` channel on irc.freenode.net and talk about what you would like to do or add first. This not only helps everyone know what's going on, but it also helps save time and effort if the community decides some changes are needed.

If you're experiencing a problem that you feel is a bug in AWX or have ideas for improving AWX, we encourage you to open an issue and share your feedback. But before opening a new issue, we ask that you please take a look at our [Issues guide](./ISSUES.md).
