AWX provides a web-based user interface, REST API, and task engine built on top of [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible). It is one of the upstream projects for [Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform](https://www.ansible.com/products/automation-platform).

To install AWX, please view the [Install guide](./INSTALL.md).

To learn more about using AWX, view the [AWX docs site](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/awx/en/latest/).

The AWX Project Frequently Asked Questions can be found [here](https://www.ansible.com/awx-project-faq).

The AWX logos and branding assets are covered by [our trademark guidelines](https://github.com/ansible/awx-logos/blob/master/TRADEMARKS.md).

Contributing
------------

- Refer to the [Contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started developing, testing, and building AWX.
- All code submissions are made through pull requests against the `devel` branch.
- All contributors must use `git commit --signoff` for any commit to be merged and agree that usage of `--signoff` constitutes agreement with the terms of [DCO 1.1](./DCO_1_1.md)
- Take care to make sure no merge commits are in the submission, and use `git rebase` vs. `git merge` for this reason.
- If submitting a large code change, it's a good idea to join discuss via the [Ansible Forum](https://forum.ansible.com/tag/awx). This helps everyone know what's going on, and it also helps save time and effort if the community decides some changes are needed.

Reporting Issues
----------------

If you're experiencing a problem that you feel is a bug in AWX or have ideas for improving AWX, we encourage you to open an issue and share your feedback. But before opening a new issue, we ask that you please take a look at our [Issues guide](./ISSUES.md).
