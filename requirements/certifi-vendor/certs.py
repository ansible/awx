requests.certs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This module returns the preferred default CA certificate bundle. There is
only one â€” the one from the certifi package.

If you are packaging Requests, e.g., for a Linux distribution or a managed
environment, you can change the definition of where() to return a separately
packaged CA bundle.

This AWX-patched package returns "/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt" provided
by the ca-certificates RPM package.

    """Return the absolute path to the system CA bundle."""
    return '/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt'
