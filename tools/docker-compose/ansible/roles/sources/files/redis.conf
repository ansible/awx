# Do not actually listen to any tcp port

# listen on the public interface. Port 0 causes it to NOT listen on
# the public interface. Adding the below line is an extra precaution.
# If a developer comes by later and wants to listen on a tcp port and changes
# the above port, it will ONLY listen on the local interface.
