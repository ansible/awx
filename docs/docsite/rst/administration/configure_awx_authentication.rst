Through the AWX user interface, you can set up a simplified login through various authentication types: GitHub, Google, LDAP, RADIUS, and SAML. After you create and register your developer application with the appropriate service, you can set up authorizations for them.  

1. From the left navigation bar, click **Settings**. 

2. The left side of the Settings window is a set of configurable Authentication settings. Select from the following options:

- :ref:`ag_auth_azure` 
- :ref:`ag_auth_github`
- :ref:`ag_auth_google_oauth2` 
- :ref:`LDAP settings <ag_auth_ldap>` 
- :ref:`ag_auth_radius` 
- :ref:`ag_auth_saml` 
- :ref:`ag_auth_tacacs`
- :ref:`ag_auth_oidc`


Different authentication types require you to enter different information. Be sure to include all the information as required.

3. Click **Save** to apply the settings or **Cancel** to abandon the changes.
