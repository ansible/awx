Inventory scripts have been discontinued. For more information, see :ref:`ug_customscripts` in the |atu|.


If you use custom inventory scripts, migrate to sourcing these scripts from a project. See :ref:`ag_inv_import` in the subsequent chapter, and also refer to :ref:`ug_inventory_sources` in the |atu| for more detail.

If you are setting up an inventory file, refer to the `Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform Installation Guide <https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.2/html/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform_installation_guide/assembly-platform-install-scenario#editing_the_red_hat_ansible_automation_platform_installer_inventory_file>`_ on `access.redhat.com <https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform>`_ and find examples specific to your setup.

If you are migrating to |ees|, see:

- :ref:`upgrade_venv` 
- `Automation mesh design patterns <https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.2/html/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform_automation_mesh_guide/design-patterns>`_
- :ref:`mesh_topology_ee` in the |atumg| to validate your topology

To learn more about automation mesh, refer to the `Red Hat Ansible Automation Mesh Guide <https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.2/html/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform_automation_mesh_guide/assembly-planning-mesh>`_ on `access.redhat.com <https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform>`_.

If you already have a mesh topology set up and want to view node type, node health, and specific details about each node, see :ref:`ag_topology_viewer` later in this guide.
