Inventory scripts have been discontinued. For more information, see :ref:`ug_customscripts` in the |atu|.


If you use custom inventory scripts, migrate to sourcing these scripts from a project. See :ref:`ag_inv_import` in the subsequent chapter, and also refer to :ref:`ug_inventory_sources` in the |atu| for more detail.

If you are migrating to |ees|, see:

- :ref:`upgrade_venv` 
- :ref:`mesh_topology_ee` in the |atumg| to validate your topology

If you already have a mesh topology set up and want to view node type, node health, and specific details about each node, see :ref:`ag_topology_viewer` later in this guide.
