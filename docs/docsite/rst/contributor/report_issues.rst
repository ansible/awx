Reporting Issues
================

To report issues you find in the AWX documentation, use the GitHub `issue tracker <https://github.com/ansible/awx/issues>`_ for filing bugs. In order to save time, and help us respond to issues quickly, make sure to fill out as much of the issue template
as possible. Version information, and an accurate reproducing scenario are critical to helping us identify the problem.

Be sure to attach the ``component:docs`` label to your issue. These labels are determined by the template data. Please use the template and fill it out as accurately as possible.

Please don't use the issue tracker as a way to ask how to do something. Instead, discuss it on on the Ansible Forum, or you can chat with us and ask questions on Matrix. See the :ref:`Communication guide<communication>` for details.

Before opening a new issue, please use the issue search feature to see if what you're experiencing has already been reported. If you have any extra detail to provide, please comment. Otherwise, rather than posting a "me too" comment, please consider giving it a `"thumbs up" <https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comment>`_ to give us an indication of the severity of the problem.

See `How issues are resolved <https://github.com/ansible/awx/blob/devel/ISSUES.md#how-issues-are-resolved>`_ for more information about the triaging and resolution process.
