From the left navigation bar, click **Organizations**.

.. index::
   single: organization; default


A default organization has been automatically created and is available to all users of AWX. It can be used as is or edited later as needed, but deleting it is not recommended.  

For the purpose of this Quick Start Guide, leave the default organization as is.

To edit the default organization later, expand its properties by clicking the Edit (|edit|) button and entering the appropriate details, then save your changes.
