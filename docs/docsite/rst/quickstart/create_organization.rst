   single: organizations

An organization is a logical collection of users, teams, projects, and inventories. It is the highest level object in the controller object hierarchy.

From the left navigation bar, click **Organizations**. 

.. note::
    The automation controller creates a default organization automatically. Users of Tower with a Self-support level license only have the default organization available and should **not** delete it.

.. index::
   single: organization; default


A default organization has been automatically created and is available to all users of the automation controller. It can be used as is or edited later as needed. 

For the purpose of this Quick Start Guide, leave the default organization as is.

To edit the default organization later, expand its properties by clicking the Edit (|edit|) button and entering the appropriate details, then save your changes.
