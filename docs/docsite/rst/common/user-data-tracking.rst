Usability data collection is included with |at| to collect data to better understand how controller users specifically interact with it, to help enhance future releases, and to continue streamlining your user experience.

Only users installing a trial of |rhaap| or a fresh installation of |at| are opted-in for this data collection. 

|At| collects user data automatically to help improve the product. You can opt out or control the way the controller collects data by setting your participation level in the **User Interface settings** in the Settings menu.

1. Click **Settings** from the left navigation bar and select **User Interface settings**. 

2. Click **Edit**.
