Credentials
===============

.. index:: 
   single: credentials

Credentials are utilized for authentication when launching Jobs against machines, synchronizing with inventory sources, and importing project content from a version control system.

You can grant users and teams the ability to use these credentials, without actually exposing the credential to the user. If you have a user move to a different team or leave the organization, you donâ€™t have to re-key all of your systems just because that credential was available in AWX.

.. note::

    AWX encrypts passwords and key information in the database and never makes secret information visible via the API. See :ref:`ag_secret_handling` in the |ata| for details.

.. _how_credentials_work:

Understanding How Credentials Work
------------------------------------

.. index:: 
    pair: credentials; how they work

AWX uses SSH to connect to remote hosts (or the Windows equivalent).  In order to pass the key from AWX to SSH, the key must be decrypted before it can be written a named pipe. AWX then uses that pipe to send the key to SSH (so that it is never written to disk).   

If passwords are used, AWX handles those by responding directly to the password prompt and decrypting the password before writing it to the prompt.

.. (commented out from note above, add back once api guide is extended again) Refer to :ref:`Unified Job List API Endpoint <unified_job_list>` in the |atapi| for more information.



Getting Started with Credentials
----------------------------------

Credential Types
-----------------

.. index:: 
   single: credentials; types
   single: credential types

The following credential types are supported with AWX:

.. contents::
    :local:

The credential types associated with AWS Secrets Manager, Centrify, CyberArk, HashiCorp Vault, Microsoft Azure Key Management System (KMS), and Thycotic are part of the credential plugins capability that allows an external system to lookup your secrets information. See the :ref:`ug_credential_plugins` section for further detail.


.. _ug_credentials_aws:

Amazon Web Services
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. index::
   pair: credential types; Amazon Web Services

Selecting this credential type enables synchronization of cloud inventory with Amazon Web Services.

AWX uses the following environment variables for AWS credentials and are fields prompted in the user interface:

::

  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
  AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN

|Credentials - create AWS credential|

.. |Credentials - create AWS credential| image:: ../common/images/credentials-create-aws-credential.png
    :alt: Credentials - create AWS credential form

Traditional Amazon Web Services credentials consist of the AWS **Access Key** and **Secret Key**. 

AWX provides support for EC2 STS tokens (sometimes referred to as IAM STS credentials). Security Token Service (STS) is a web service that enables you to request temporary, limited-privilege credentials for AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. To learn more about the IAM/EC2 STS Token, refer to: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html

.. note::

  If the value of your tags in EC2 contain booleans (yes/no/true/false), you must remember to quote them.

.. warning::

  To use implicit IAM role credentials, do not attach AWS cloud credentials in AWX when relying on IAM roles to access the AWS API.  While it may seem to make sense to attach your AWS cloud credential to your job template, doing so will force the use of your AWS credentials and will not "fall through" to use your IAM role credentials (this is due to the use of the boto library.)

Insights credentials consist of the Insights **Username** and **Password**, which is the userâ€™s Red Hat Customer Portal Account username and password.


Machine
^^^^^^^^

.. index::
   pair: credential types; machine


Machine credentials enable AWX to invoke Ansible on hosts under your management. Just like using Ansible on the command line, you can specify the SSH username, optionally provide a password, an SSH key, a key password, or even have AWX prompt the user for their password at deployment time. They define ssh and user-level privilege escalation access for playbooks, and are used when submitting jobs to run playbooks on a remote host. Network connections (``httpapi``, ``netconf``, and ``network_cli``) use **Machine** for the credential type.

Machine/SSH credentials do not use environment variables. Instead, they pass the username via the ``ansible -u`` flag, and interactively write the SSH password when the underlying SSH client prompts for it.

|Credentials - create machine credential|

.. |Credentials - create machine credential| image:: ../common/images/credentials-create-machine-credential.png
    :alt: Credentials - create machine credential form

Machine credentials have several attributes that may be configured:

- **Username**: The username to be used for SSH authentication.
- **Password**: The actual password to be used for SSH authentication. This password will be stored encrypted in the database, if entered. Alternatively, you can configure AWX to ask the user for the password at launch time by selecting **Prompt on launch**. In these cases, a dialog opens when the job is launched, promoting the user to enter the password and password confirmation.
- **SSH Private Key**: Copy or drag-and-drop the SSH private key for the machine credential.
- **Private Key Passphrase**: If the SSH Private Key used is protected by a password, you can configure a Key Password for the private key. This password will be stored encrypted in the database, if entered. Alternatively, you can configure AWX to ask the user for the password at launch time by selecting **Prompt on launch**. In these cases, a dialog opens when the job is launched, prompting the user to enter the password and password confirmation.
- **Privilege Escalation Method**: Specifies the type of escalation privilege to assign to specific users. This is equivalent to specifying the ``--become-method=BECOME_METHOD`` parameter, where ``BECOME_METHOD`` could be any of the typical methods described below, or a custom method you've written. Begin entering the name of the method, and the appropriate name auto-populates.

.. image:: ../common/images/credentials-create-machine-credential-priv-escalation.png
    :alt: Credentials - create machine credential privilege escalation drop-down menu


- empty selection: If a task/play has ``become`` set to ``yes`` and is used with an empty selection, then it will default to ``sudo``
- **sudo**: Performs single commands with super user (root user) privileges
- **su**: Switches to the super user (root user) account (or to other user accounts)
- **pbrun**:  Requests that an application or command be run in a controlled account and provides for advanced root privilege delegation and keylogging
- **pfexec**: Executes commands with predefined process attributes, such as specific user or group IDs
- **dzdo**: An enhanced version of sudo that uses RBAC information in an Centrify's Active Directory service (see Centrify's `site on DZDO <http://community.centrify.com/t5/Centrify-Server-Suite/FAQ-What-is-DirectAuthorize-dzdo-dzwin/td-p/21193>`_)
- **pmrun**: Requests that an application is run in a controlled account (refer to `Privilege Manager for Unix 6.0 <http://documents.software.dell.com/privilege-manager-for-unix/6.0/administrators-guide/privilege-manager-programs/pmrun>`_)
- **runas**: Allows you to run as the current user
- **enable**: Switches to elevated permissions on a network device
- **doas**: Allows your remote/login user to execute commands as another user via the doas ("Do as user") utility
- **ksu**: Allows your remote/login user to execute commands as another user via Kerberos access
- **machinectl**: Allows you to manage containers via the systemd machine manager
- **sesu**: Allows your remote/login user to execute commands as another user via the CA Privileged Access Manager

.. note::
   Custom ``become`` plugins are available only starting with Ansible 2.8. For more detail on this concept, refer to `Understanding Privilege Escalation  https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/become.html` and the `list of become plugins https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/plugins/become.html#plugin-list`.

- **Privilege Escalation Username** field is only seen if an option for privilege escalation is selected. Enter the username to use with escalation privileges on the remote system.
- **Privilege Escalation Password**: field is only seen if an option for privilege escalation is selected. Enter the actual password to be used to authenticate the user via the selected privilege escalation type on the remote system. This password will be stored encrypted in the database, if entered. Alternatively, you may configure AWX to ask the user for the password at launch time by selecting **Prompt on launch**. In these cases, a dialog opens when the job is launched, promoting the user to enter the password and password confirmation.

.. note::
   Sudo Password must be used in combination with SSH passwords or SSH Private Keys, since AWX must first establish an authenticated SSH connection with the host prior to invoking sudo to change to the sudo user.

.. warning::
   Credentials which are used in *Scheduled Jobs* must not be configured as "**Prompt on launch**".
