2. An organization has several attributes that may be configured:

- Enter the **Name** for your organization (required).
- Enter a **Description** for the organization.
- Enter **Instance Groups** on which to run this organization. 
- Enter the name of the execution environment or search for an existing **Execution Environment** on which to run this organization. See :ref:`ug_execution_environments` for more information.
- If used, enter the **Galaxy Credentials** or search from a list of existing ones.

3. Click **Save** to finish creating the organization.

Once created, AWX displays the Organization details, and allows for the managing access and execution environments for the organization.

Work with Access
------------------

   pair: organizations; access
   pair; organizations; teams


Clicking on **Access** (beside **Details** when viewing your organization), displays all the Users associated with this Organization and their roles.

As you can manage the user membership for this Organization here, you can manage user membership on a per-user basis from the Users page by clicking **Users** from the left navigation bar. Organizations have a unique set of roles not described here. You can assign specific users certain levels of permissions within your organization, or allow them to act as an admin for a particular resource. Refer to :ref:`rbac-ug` for more information. 

Clicking on a user brings up that user's details, allowing you to review, grant, edit, and remove associated permissions for that user. For more information, refer to :ref:`ug_users`.

Add a User or Team
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to add a user or team to an organization, the user or team must already be created. See :ref:`ug_users_create` and :ref:`ug_team_create` for additional detail. To add existing users or team to the Organization:

.. include:: ../common/permissions.rst



.. note::

  A user or team with roles associated will retain them even after they have been reassigned to another organization.



Work with Notifications
--------------------------------

.. index::
   pair: organizations; notifications

Clicking the **Notifications** tab allows you to review any notification integrations you have setup.

Use the toggles to enable or disable the notifications to use with your particular organization. For more detail, see :ref:`ug_notifications_on_off`. 

If no notifications have been set up, you must create them from the **Notifications** option on the left navigation bar.
