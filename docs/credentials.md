Server Side Generation of Private Data
======================================

In order to prevent unnecessary transfer of sensitive data, a user can
have the server generate a private SSH key and save it to the database.

Using the $generate$ keyword
----------------------------

In order to use this feature, the keyword "$generate$" can be placed inside
of a dictionary that then takes the place of an input in the credential
``inputs`` dictionary. This will, itself, define a dictionary of arguments
which can be used as configurable parameters for the generation.

Example:

    HTTP POST /api/v2/credentials/

    {
        "name": "Joe's Third Party Cloud API Token",
        "organization": <pk>,
        "credential_type": <pk>,
        "inputs": {
            "ssh_key_data": {"$generate$": {"key_size": 2048}}
        }
    }

This will create a credential with an SSH key generated by the server
with a key size of 2048.

The options for generating a key are shown in the credential type API
for machine credentials under ``summary_fields`` and ``allowed_generators``.

Display of Public Data
======================

It is expected that a system administrator will have the server generate
an private SSH key, and then distribute the public key to servers that will
be managed by AWX.

To obtain the private key, visit ``/api/v2/credentials/<pk>/public_data/``
for the credential produced in the prior step.
