  consistent with job templates, model changes for [[#277](https://github.com/ansible/awx/issues/277)]
* Removed `TOWER_HOST` as a default environment variable in job running environment
  due to conflict with tower credential type. Playbook authors should replace their

  [[#34](https://github.com/ansible/awx/issues/34)].
* Use events for running inventory updates, project updates, and other unified job
  types [[#200](https://github.com/ansible/awx/issues/200)].

  emission, replacing server restart. Allows use in OpenShift deployments.
* Allow job templates using previously-synced git projects to run without network
  access to source control [[#287](https://github.com/ansible/awx/issues/287)].
* Automatically run a project update if sensitive fields change like `scm_url`.
* Disallow relaunching jobs with `execute_role` if another user provided prompts.
* Show all teams to organization admins if setting `ORG_ADMINS_CAN_SEE_ALL_USERS` is enabled.
* Allow creating schedules and workflow nodes from job templates that use
  credentials which prompt for passwords if `ask_credential_on_launch` is set.
* Set `execution_node` in task manager and submit `waiting` jobs to only the
  queue for the specific instance job is targeted to run on
  [[#1873](https://github.com/ansible/awx/issues/1873)].

* Added `inventory` field to inventory updates

3.2.0
=====
* added a new API endpoint - `/api/v1/settings/logging/test/` - for testing
  external log aggregrator connectivity
  [[#5164](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-tower/issues/5164)]
* allow passing `-e create_preload_data=False` to skip creating default
  organization/project/inventory/credential/job_template during Tower
  installation
  [[#5746](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-tower/issues/5746)]
* removed links from group to `inventory_source` including the field and
  related links, removed `start` and `schedule` capabilities from
  group serializer and added `user_capabilities` to inventory source
  serializer, allow user creation and naming of inventory sources
  [[#5741](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-tower/issues/5741)]
* support sourcing inventory from a file inside of a project's source
  tree [[#2477](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-tower/issues/2477)]

  files) at `ansible-playbook` runtime
  [[#5876](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-tower/issues/5876)]

  [[#2913](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-tower/issues/2913)]

  an environment variable or a file's contents)

  [[#6231](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-tower/pull/6231)]
* Tower now uses a modified version of [Fernet](https://github.com/fernet/spec/blob/master/Spec.md).
  Our `Fernet256` class uses `AES-256-CBC` instead of `AES-128-CBC` for all encrypted fields.
  [[#826](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-tower/issues/826)]
* Added the ability to set custom environment variables set for playbook runs,
  inventory updates, project updates, and notification sending.
  [[#3508](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-tower/issues/3508)]

  which backward compatibility support for 3.1 use pattern
