### Denied Submission

- Hi! \
\
Thanks very much for your submission to AWX. It means a lot to us that you have taken time to contribute. \
\
At this time we do not want to merge this PR. Our reasons for this are: \
\
(A) INSERT ITEM HERE \
\
Please know that we are always up for discussion but this project is very active. Because of this, we're unlikely to see comments made on closed PRs, and we lock them after some time. If you or anyone else has any further questions, please let us know by using any of the communication methods listed in the page below: \
\
https://github.com/ansible/awx/#get-involved \
\
In the future, sometimes starting a discussion on the development list prior to implementing a feature can make getting things included a little easier, but it is not always necessary. \
\
Thank you once again for this and your interest in AWX!
