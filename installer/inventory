# Kubernetes and Openshift Install Resource Requests
# This is the request value for a pod's "task" container, which is the container
# used to run jobs. The other containers have a fixed resource request. The total amount
# of requested resources for a pod is the sum of all resources requested by all containers
# in the pod
# A cpu_request of 1500 is 1.5 cores for the task container
# A mem_request of 2 is for 2 gigabytes of memory for the task container

# Use a local distribution build container image for building the AWX package
# This is helpful if you don't want to bother installing the build-time dependencies as
# it is taken care of already.
# NOTE: IMPORTANT: If you are running a mininshift install, using this container might not work
#                  if you are using certain drivers like KVM where the source tree can't be mapped
#                  into the build container.
#                  Thus this setting must be set to False which will trigger a local build. To view the
#                  typical dependencies that you might need to install see:
